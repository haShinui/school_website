class CustomLoginView(LoginView):
    def get(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Redirect to your Vue.js frontend login route
        return redirect('http://localhost:8082/microsoft-login')

    def post(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Handle the post if necessary or redirect again
        return redirect('http://localhost:8082/microsoft-login')


        can u now make a new login page that combines the microsft login and also the normal allauth login and then when the user is logged in there is a button top right of app.vue bar that when ckicked, logs him out




        Sure! Here's a reminder for later:

Things to do after setting up your secure admin with Allauth and setting up login with POST and CSRF:

    Implement Secure Cookies: Ensure that cookies are securely handled in your Django settings, especially for session and CSRF cookies.
    Enable HTTPS: Ensure that your entire site is served over HTTPS, including setting up HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).
    Configure Secure Headers: Consider implementing additional security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and Subresource Integrity (SRI).
    Verify CSRF Protection: Ensure that your CSRF protection is properly implemented and that tokens are correctly handled in both your Django backend and Vue.js frontend.
    Test Security Measures: Thoroughly test your security measures, including CSRF protection and secure cookies, to ensure that everything is working as expected in a production-like environment.
